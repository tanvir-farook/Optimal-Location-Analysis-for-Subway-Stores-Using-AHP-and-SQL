## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages the **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** and **SQL** to determine the best location for a new Subway store. We analyze multiple factors such as foot traffic, proximity to attractions, and demographic suitability across counties to rank potential store locations.

By combining structured decision-making (AHP) with real-world SQL data wrangling, we deliver **data-backed location intelligence** for strategic retail expansion.

## 🧠 Key Techniques Used

- 🧮 **AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process):** for multi-criteria decision modeling
- 🧵 **SQL (Structured Query Language):** for data cleaning, joining, and feature aggregation
- 🗺️ Location-based ranking based on population, amusement park proximity, and store density
- 📊 Data-driven decision matrix to prioritize counties
